Part I: Live Updating Calculator
  a. This Calculator is separated by content, appearence, and behavior in respective HTML, CSS, and JS files. 
  b. Go ahead, type in some numbers! The user input is automatically computed when any (valid) input is changed. Calculate away. 
  Basically the future of our phone calculator, except this has swanky colors and support only simple functions. 

Part II: Weather Widget
  a. This widget performs an AJAX request to fetch current weather at a random fun location!
  b. Refresh away, you'll always be on your toes with a new fun weather update. Call your friends! Remind them it's raining. 
  c. All actions are performed over AJAX with no need to refresh the page. Code in HTML, CSS (hosted on an ec2 instance), and JS.
